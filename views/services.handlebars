AttaPlumbing's professionals handle the installation and pressure testing of the pipes, ensuring the system is safe and compliant with all San Diego building codes. The underground installation terminates at the foundation of the building, where the natural gas provider installs a gas meter. From this meter, gas piping can be routed underground to various access points throughout the building. However, it is most commonly routed through walls or the attic to facilitate easier access and future modifications.</p>
